My name is Tomasz Tarando. My exposure to Site Reliability Engineering practices started around 2017 and at this point I consider myself quite an experienced SRE. Since 2017 I've been working for small, medium and large organizations with different levels of technical capabilities and different levels of SRE adoption. I was fortunate to meet and work with super-smart people who helped me a ton along the way.

I started this blog to share and contribute back to community. I also started this with a hope that it becomes something more one day but without clear definition as to what it might be.

If there is anything you think we may want to do together please feel encouraged to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ttarando/).
